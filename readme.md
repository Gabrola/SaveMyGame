## SaveMyGame

SaveMyGa.me was a website that allowed League of Legends players to record all of their games without the need of installing any 3rd party applications. The service works by constantly monitoring the player's summoner if it is in a game or not, and then starts downloading the spectator format replay, which it can later stream the user at any time. The project was killed due to increasing server costs.
Back-end was developed entirely using PHP Laravel 5.1 and the front-end using the Material Design framework Materialize
